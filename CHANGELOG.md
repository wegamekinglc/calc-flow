# Changelog

This file records fundamental changes to Calc Flow's public surfaces and
engine or Studio capabilities.

## 2026-07

- Add versioned Studio runtime and preview-worker discovery at
  `GET /api/v2/capabilities`, and model validation, run-state, and table/array
  result responses as closed unions. This is an intentional generated
  TypeScript client source break that requires consumers to regenerate and
  migrate; `/api/v2/catalog` remains a UDF-only compatibility route.
